File 9 contains Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks. In this i created a dictionary named dict, and added the names and the marks of the students.I used if statement which would give the marks of the student if the name is in dict; if the name is not found then it would print so.
File 10 contains Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing. In this i created list 'l' then extracted a list from 'l', 'extracted_list'. Then i reversed the list and printed the statement as in the output asked. I didn't used the extracted_list as a direct list in the second comand as the reverse comand reversed the original one, instead i used range from the original list.
